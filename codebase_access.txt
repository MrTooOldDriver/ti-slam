https://github.com/MrTooOldDriver/ti-slam/blob/main/readme_conda.md

For embeeding FL training, run embedding_client.py

For neural odom FL training, run deeptio_prob_fl.py

For neural loop closure training, run loop_pose_fl.py

The rest of the TI-SLAM training process are remain the same. Please refer to TI-SLAM readme in the repo for how to running then. For how to eval the final result for FTI-SLAM, please also refer to TI-SLAM readme, you will need matlab for it:
